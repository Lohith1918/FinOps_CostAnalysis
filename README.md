# Augmented FinOps using Machine Learning
This project uses machine learning to enhance FinOps (Financial Operations) for cloud cost management. It provides tools for cost forecasting, anomaly detection, and optimization to help organizations manage their cloud spending more effectively. ü§ñ

# üìú Description
Managing cloud costs is a major challenge due to unpredictable spending and hidden inefficiencies. This project addresses these issues by applying machine learning techniques to automate cloud cost analysis.

The main goals are:

Cost Forecasting: Predict future cloud expenses using historical data.

Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual spending patterns with statistical methods and machine learning.

Cost Optimization: Offer insights through clustering analysis to improve resource use.

The project is built in Python and uses popular data science libraries.

# ‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To get this project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone (https://github.com/Lohith1918/FinOps_CostAnalysis.git)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd augmented-finops-project

Install the required packages:
It's a good idea to use a virtual environment.

pip install -r requirements.txt

# üöÄ Usage
The main analysis is in the FinOps_Cost_Analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.

To run it:

Start Jupyter Notebook from your terminal:

jupyter notebook

Open FinOps_Cost_Analysis.ipynb and run the cells sequentially.

The notebook loads the cloud cost data, cleans it, and then applies various machine learning models for analysis.

# ‚ú® Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Loads and cleans cloud cost data from a CSV file.

Anomaly Detection:

Uses the Z-Score method to find statistical outliers.

Applies the Isolation Forest algorithm for a machine learning-based approach to anomaly detection.

Cost Forecasting:

Includes a Linear Regression model to predict future costs.

An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network is also explored for more advanced time-series forecasting.

Clustering Analysis:

Uses K-Means clustering to group costs into different tiers, which helps in creating targeted optimization strategies.

# üìä Results
The analysis successfully identified several key insights:

Anomalies Detected: The models found 5 critical cost anomalies, with expenses over $1105.

Cost Clusters: The data was grouped into three main spending tiers, which can help guide different management approaches.

Forecasting: The models provide a solid baseline for predicting future cloud spending.

Dependencies
